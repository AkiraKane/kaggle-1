Welcome to the Kaggle subgroup of [TensorFlow NW](https://www.meetup.com/TensorFlow-Northwest/)!

## Purpose
The purpose of this subgroup is to support teams and individuals actively participating in Kaggle competitions using TensorFlow.

If you are a Portlander interested in TensorFlow but not ready or able to commit the time to actively compete, then just coming to the monthly [TensorFlow NW](https://www.meetup.com/TensorFlow-Northwest/) meetings might suit you better.
<!--- The phrasing of this is a tad ambiguous. It may suggest to some that the subgroup is only available to those interested in participating in Kaggle competitions that require TF. Suggestion for what I think you're looking for:  
This subgroup is for members of the TF-NW Meetup interested in applying/testing/honing TensorFlow tools on Kaggle competitions.

## About TensorFlow NW
TensorFlow NW is a Portland, OR, area Meetup. The group is for anyone who's interested in learning about or advancing their knowledge of TensorFlow's use cases and applications.

## About Kaggle
[Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) is a place for data scientists and machine learning engineers of all levels to hone their craft though solving real-world problems on hundreds of datasets. The platform also hosts competitions where data scientists can work in teams to apply state-of-the-art technologies on current business problems.

And the best part is, Kaggle supports running Python notebooks and R markdown files in browser so you don’t have to wrestle with libraries, dependencies, or finicky source code. <!--- Huzzah! ? ---> Check out [this intro video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoRSIdLpFqU) to learn more.
<!--- Not sure if you really need the video link tbh, since you explain everything it tells you. But the animations are pretty adorable. --->

## Getting started
This subgroup is designed for those who are familiar with Kaggle, Python, and TensorFlow — ready to jump right in and compete. If you are new to any of these, we would love for you to participate and join! You’ll have to do a decent amount of work on your own to get caught up to the rest of the group.
<!--- That first line is a bit awkward. I think to keep it structured as you have it, you could do: This subgroup is designed for those who — familiar with Kaggle, Python, and TensorFlow — are ready to jump right in and compete. --->

Alternatively: This subgroup is designed for those who are ready to jump right in and compete. If you are new to Kaggle, Python, or TensorFlow, we would still love for you to participate and join (but you'll have to work on your own to catch up).

Here’s what we suggest:
1. Request to join the [TensorFlow NW slack workspace](https://tf-nw.slack.com/) by contacting Bryan Holman at bryanpholman [at] gmail [dot] com. Once you are given access, introduce yourself to the other members of the group!
2. Register on [kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com/) and check out the site!
3. Get introduced to [Kaggle Kernels](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FloMHMOU5Bs)!
4. Enter your [first Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer), recognizing hand-written numbers with the classic MNIST dataset. We have prepared [this guide](https://github.com/tensorflow-northwest/kaggle/blob/master/getting_started.md) for entering the competition, building your first kernel, and submitting predictions.

If any of these steps is beyond your capabilities, please see the resources section below. Also feel free to reach out on the slack workspace, and come to the [subgroup meetings](https://www.meetup.com/TensorFlow-Northwest/)! We meet the 1st and 3rd Saturdays of every month at [The Tech Academy Portland](https://www.learncodinganywhere.com/).

## Resources
While TensorFlow was originally developed for [Python](https://www.python.org/), APIs/interfaces exist for [R](https://tensorflow.rstudio.com/), [Java](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/install_java), and [more](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/)! But as a group, we typically work in Python.

<!--- You kind of contradict yourself here. Earlier you say that if someone is new to this, they need to catch up. Here you say it's not an issue. I think this is more what you're going for so I gave a suggested change in the previous comment. --->

If you are new to python, TensorFlow, machine learning or deep learning, please do not worry! Everyone was new to these technologies at one point. Fortunately there are hundreds of hours of amazing content online, taught by field experts, that can be accessed for very little cost (or even free!).

If you are new to Python, we recommend the following:
* A (very) brief, but free crash course at [learnpython.org](https://www.learnpython.org/).
* Jose Portilla’s [Python for Data Science and Machine Learning Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/python-for-data-science-and-machine-learning-bootcamp/) on [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/) (typically less than $20).
<!--- This is also a pretty solid free tutorial https://community.modeanalytics.com/python/. Might also suggest codefights or hackerearth for practicing python skills as well? --->

If you are new to TensorFlow:
* Google’s [Machine Learning Crash Course](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/) with TensorFlow (free).

New to machine learning? Check out:
* Google’s [Machine Learning Crash Course](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/) with TensorFlow (free).
* Andrew Ng’s [machine learning course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) (free).

New to deep learning?
* Andrew Ng’s [deep learning specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning) ($50 per month).
* [Fast.ai](http://course.fast.ai/), which leverages the PyTorch framework instead of TensorFlow but is free!
* [Stanford’s cs231n YouTube lectures](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3FW7Lu3i5JvHM8ljYj-zLfQRF3EO8sYv) give an in-depth look at convolutional neural networks and computer vision.
* [Stanford’s cs224n Youtube lectures](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3FW7Lu3i5Jsnh1rnUwq_TcylNr7EkRe6) provide an extensive overview of recurrent neural networks and natural language processing.
