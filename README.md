Welcome to the Kaggle subgroup of [TensorFlow NW](https://www.meetup.com/TensorFlow-Northwest/)!

## Purpose
The purpose of this subgroup is to support teams and individuals actively participating in Kaggle competitions using TensorFlow.

If you are a Portlander interested in TensorFlow but not ready or able to commit time to actively compete, then just coming to the monthly [TensorFlow NW](https://www.meetup.com/TensorFlow-Northwest/) meetings will suit you better.

## About TensorFlow NW
TensorFlow NW is a Portland, OR, area Meetup. The group is for anyone who's interested in learning about or advancing their knowledge of TensorFlow, its use cases and applications.

## About Kaggle
[Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) is a platform for current and aspiring data scientists and machine learning engineers (check out [this intro video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoRSIdLpFqU)). Kaggle is a great place to find hundreds of datasets and the ability to solve real-world data problems to hone your data science chops. Kaggle supports running Python notebooks and R markdown files in browser so you don’t have to wrestle with libraries, dependencies, or finicky source code.

Additionally, Kaggle hosts data science competitions where individuals can work together in teams to apply state-of-the-art technologies on current business problems.

## Getting started
This subgroup is designed for those who are familiar with Kaggle, Python, and TensorFlow — ready to jump right in and compete. If you are new to any of these, we would love for you to participate and join! You’ll have to do a decent amount of work on your own to get caught up to the rest of the group.

Here’s what we suggest:
1. Request to join the [TensorFlow NW slack workspace](https://tf-nw.slack.com/) by contacting Bryan Holman at bryanpholman [at] gmail [dot] com. Once you are given access, introduce yourself to the other members of the group!
2. Head over to [kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com/) and register and check out the site!
3. Get introduced to [Kaggle Kernels](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FloMHMOU5Bs)!
4. Enter your [first Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer), recognizing hand-written numbers with the classic MNIST dataset. We have prepared [this guide](link!) for entering the competition, building your first kernel, and submitting predictions.

If any of these steps is beyond your capabilities, please see the resources section below. Also feel free to reach out on the slack workspace, and come to the [subgroup meetings](https://www.meetup.com/TensorFlow-Northwest/)! We meet the 1st and 3rd Saturdays of every month at [The Tech Academy Portland](https://www.learncodinganywhere.com/).

## Resources
While originally developed for [Python](https://www.python.org/), APIs/interfaces have been developed so that TensorFlow can be used in [R](https://tensorflow.rstudio.com/), [Java](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/install_java), and [more](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/)! As a group, we typically work in Python.

If you are new to python, TensorFlow, machine learning or deep learning, please do not worry! Everyone was new to these technologies at one point. Fortunately there are hundreds of hours of amazing content online, taught by field experts, that can be accessed for very little cost (or even free!).

If you are new to Python, we recommend the following:
* A (very) brief, but free crash course at [learnpython.org](https://www.learnpython.org/).
* Jose Portilla’s [Python for Data Science and Machine Learning Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/python-for-data-science-and-machine-learning-bootcamp/) on [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/) (typically less than $20).

If you are new to TensorFlow:
* Google’s [Machine Learning Crash Course](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/) with TensorFlow (free).

New to machine learning? Check out:
* Google’s [Machine Learning Crash Course](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/) with TensorFlow (free).
* Andrew Ng’s [machine learning course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) (free).

New to deep learning?
* Andrew Ng’s [deep learning specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning) ($50 per month).
* [Fast.ai](http://course.fast.ai/), which leverages the PyTorch framework instead of TensorFlow but is free!
* [Stanford’s cs231n YouTube lectures](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3FW7Lu3i5JvHM8ljYj-zLfQRF3EO8sYv) give an in-depth look at convolutional neural networks and computer vision.
* [Stanford’s cs224n Youtube lectures](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3FW7Lu3i5Jsnh1rnUwq_TcylNr7EkRe6) provide an extensive overview of recurrent neural networks and natural language processing.
