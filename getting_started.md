# Getting started with TensorFlow and Kaggle

This will guide you through your first Kaggle competition using TensorFlow. If you're not comfortable with Python or TensorFlow, check out the [resources section](https://github.com/tensorflow-northwest/kaggle#resources) on this repo's README.

In this guide you'll join Kaggle's Digit Recognizer competition, a classic computer vision task of correctly classifying hand-written numbers. You'll create a python notebook, design and implement a neural network, then submit predictions on test data.

## Step-by-step instructions

1. Register for [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/).
2. Enter the [Digit Recognizer](https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer) competition.
3. Start a new [Kernel](https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer/kernels).
4. Following [these code-alongs](https://github.com/andrewferlitsch/Portland-Data-Science-Group/tree/master/Presentations/CodeAlong/tfmnist), build and run your graph one line at a time.
  * Note that you will have to edit the path for the training and test data.
5. Make and submit your predictions!

And then I will post a link an amazing Kernel that I'm making!
